## Brutal truth you need to hear

- The **original notebook is teaching code**, not engineering code  
- Uploading notebooks to GitHub without refactoring is a **rookie move**
- What I gave you above is **interview-safe**, **reviewer-safe**, and **scalable**

If you want next:
- add **memory**
- add **tool routing**
- convert this into **multi-agent**
- or add **tests**

Say which one. Don’t drift.
